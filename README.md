# DBM-Drag Based Model
This repository provides the python based program for Coronal Mass Ejection(CME) arrival forecast at 1 AU using Drag Based Model(DBM) [VrË‡snak et al. (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-012-0035-4).
The folder `Model_code` consist of python notebooks for geometrical relation and different kinetmatic approach considered for CME propagation. File `Geometrical Parameters.ipynb` provides a insight of cone geometry for advance DBM. `Advance DBM.ipynb` provides a forecast of CME arrival at 1 AU with the cone geometry visuals. `kinematics-1.ipynb` and `kinematics-2.ipynb` file provides two different kinetic approach for CME propagation (Those two kinetic approach are self-similar cone expansion and flatteing cone expansion)
